# 1. Car-Price-Prediction:
### [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)
#### Aim: 
* to predict the selling prices of cars to be sold. 

* Used Lasso Regression to pick important features and then used those features in ensemble models to get better predictions.

* Also used Flask and Herulo SAS cloud platform for deploying this project.


# 2. Second hand car price prediction:
### [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sanskrutipanda/car-pricing-prediction)

#### Aim:
* to predict the selling prices of second hand cars.

* Spend most of the time in doing uni-variate and bi-variate analysis to find which all features are actually impacting the target variable i.e., selling prices of cars

* Used linear models like linear and lasso regression to predict the prices. Also used the ensemble model (RandomForest), which gave the best results
